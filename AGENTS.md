# Agent Guidelines

## GitHub Integration

### PR Management

- Always update PR title, description, and tags when instructed directly. No need to ask for confirmation.
- GitHub CLI is available and should be the tool #1 to work with GitHub.

### Commit Guidelines

- Small changes (which are tested with Swift CLI) should be committed without asking for permission.
- Commit title and description should be generated automatically.
- For complete tasks use `- [x] Task`, leaving the `- List item` for lists and sublists.

## Development Workflow

### Testing

- Always test Swift-related changes using Swift CLI before committing.
- Ensure existing tests pass before making commits.

### Code Style

- Follow existing code conventions in the project.
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible.
